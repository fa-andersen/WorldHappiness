## Introduction
In this project, I reviewed World Happiness Reports from 2015 through 2024, uncovering meaningful relationships within countries and regions using 6 key variables.

## Objective
My analysis aims to explore the trends and shifts in global happiness over the past decade, identifying the key factors driving happiness. As well as looking at using GDP with Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) over GDP per capita, as a view to equalize not just the scores, but trends with countries that normally have lower GDP. This gives these countries more equality towards happiness since this is a subjective report based on citizen's views and interpretations.

## Key Questions
1. Which countries are the Happiest? Is there a trend?

2. Which countries are the Unhappiest? Is there a trend?

3. Which regions are the Happiest/Unhappiest?

4. What changes have occurred over time by Country vs Region?

5. Which factors influence the happiness score the most/least?

6. Are there other factors that could make the Happiness Score more equal versus subjective?

## What did I do?
● Data Collection and Preparation: Using Python, I cleaned and wrangled the raw data, transforming it into structured data frames conducive to analysis.

● Exploratory Data Analysis: With a focus on understanding the World Happiness Reports and factors used to contribute to the total Happiness score. I used various statistical techniques and visualization tools to identify patterns and correlations across different countries and regions.

● 6 Key Factors Evaluation: Through rigorous analysis, I evaluated the various key factors used towards Happiness Score as well as delving into looking at an equalized approach using GDP with Power Purchasing Parity vs GDP per capita.

## Conclusions & Recommendations
With insights from the analysis, I created conclusions to the key questions and suggested recommendations to enhance future World Happiness Reports.

## Technologies & Skills used
● Python (Pandas, NumPy): for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis

● Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn): for creating visualizations

● Statistical, Correlation, and Time Series Analysis: deriving meaningful insights from the data

## Data
The World Happiness Report data came in two sets, 2015 through 2023 and 2024 via Kaggle.
