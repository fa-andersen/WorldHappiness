In this project, I reviewed World Happiness Reports from 2015 through 2024, uncovoering meaningful relationships within countries and regions using 6 key variables.

## Objective
Uncover more information about sales patterns. Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria. Present findings in an Excel Report.

## Key Questions
1. Which countries are the Happiest? Is there a trend?

2. Which countries are the Unhappiest? Is there a trend?

3. Which regions are the Happiest/Unhappiest?

4. What changes have occured over time by Country vs Region?

5. Which factors influence the happiness score the most/least?

6. Are there other factors that could make the Happiness Score more equal versus subjective?

## What did I do?
● Data Collection and Preparation: Using Python, I cleaned and wrangled the raw data, transforming it into structured data frames conducive to analysis.

● Exploratory Data Analysis: With a focus on understanding customer behavior, I used various statistical techniques and visualization tools to identify patterns and correlations across different customer segments.

● Product and Department Performance Evaluation: Through rigorous analysis, I evaluated the performance of Instacart's products and departments, pinpointing strengths and areas for improvement.

## Recommendations & Insights
With insights from the analysis, I created recommendations to enhance Instacart's operations and customer experience.

## Technologies & Skills used
● Python (Pandas, NumPy): for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis

● Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn): for creating visualizations

● Statistical, Correlation, and Time Series Analysis: deriving meaningful insights from the data

## Data
The World Happiness Report data came in two sets, 2015 through 2023 and 2024 via Kaggle.
